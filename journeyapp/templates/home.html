                    Findability and Discoverability are originally terms coined by Heater Lutze but popularized by Peter Morville to explain about the Web and internet (In 2005 he defined it as: “the ability of users to identify an appropriate Website and navigate the pages of the site to discover and retrieve relevant information resources”). However, the terms are closely related and essential for spaces of solidarity to create  a solidarity network in a complex society. Findability is a term for the ease with which spaces of solidarity can be found. It means that people can easily find the spaces of solidarity that they assume is present in the world. However, good management of solidarity network also promotes Discoverability, which means that people have great chances to encounter the spaces they don’t know that exist.

                    An empowerment portal is a tool/a medium that helps you find, discover, and allows you to express yourself. A portal links/expose individual voice to the society (singularities to the multiplicities). Through a portal, individuals have ways to contribute to the things they believe in. No matter whether a Portal is digital or physical (e.g. apps, third spaces),  it should have a certain extent of legitimacy in creating a social network where one feels comfortable and empowered to express themselves.

                    Urban Family is a term for a group of people who are not a real family, but treat each other as core members of social interaction and relationship. Social psychologists Jong-Gierveld and Van Tilburg believe that the absence of cohesive bonds in one mediating structure (family) can be compensated by the involvement in an alternative mediating structure (social partner). Indeed, when traditional “core families” decrease and mutable living arrangements(cohabitation, single-household, living apart together) increase, people have to rely more on social groups/partners rather than direct family members (Snell, K.D.M., 2017, The Rise of Living Alone and Loneliness in History). But the question is, how do people form such social groups in the contemporary world? How world at large shapes local habits of encounters?

                    This term is strongly related to Ash Amin’s concept of  “Urban Strangers” ( Land of Strangers, 2012).  In sprawling metropolis and plural society, people are more and more managed by plan, order and discipline, e.g. work, school, institutions and neighborhood. There are no surprises in daily associations, no breathable public spaces,  thus strangers have no inclination to know each other, being locked into their existing networks of intimacy and belonging.  To achieve “belonging” (solidarity, common life, shared concern and togetherness are all its metaphors), the most important thing to do is to strengthen our relations with each other through daily encounters, so that everyday urban experience really adds to our personal life. The means could be networks of decent social infrastructures which is constituted of physical spaces, public services and the public sphere.  Today there are still too many obstacles for people to shape urban life and benefit from it.

                    A common ground for being familiar with strangers, forge associations and relationships will not only lead to the formation of Urban Families, but also diminish public interest in difference, thus build the project of Multiplicity.

                    Our contemporary world, with its dynamism and plurality, is a battleground governed through bureaucratic hierarchy where one’s personal voice is submerged by the “importance” of many, or the “important”. Even though we have enjoyed much sovereignty in a digital society, the advancement of technology pushes this phenomenon more, leaving one to feel even lonelier—no longer submerged but lost in the sea of “connections”.

                    Living in metropolitan cities like Jakarta and Beijing, one would often feel helpless witnessing spatial rights taken away in front of their eyes. In these cities, many public spaces are governed by private institutions that restrict access of the public while the free ones are inadequate, constantly diminished and being replaced. In South Jakarta, Jakartans have nowhere to walk. They have to drive even within a 5-minute walk, as sidewalks are taken by parking lots and commercial sites. In Wudaokou, Beijing, people have no place to sit, as local cafes and bookstores are being replaced by expensive and exclusive restaurants. One’s right to public space is a vital part of creating social infrastructure, which is often overlooked yet has been proven to be crucial in improving civic life (Klinenberg). In cities that are more designed for cars and economic capitals rather than its inhabitants, the resort lies in the connection between existing informal community spaces, such as cafes and art centers, to rebuild the city’s social networks.

                    While the digital social platforms constantly disconnect people from reality, one cannot deny that everyday apps like Google Maps and Yelp also make life easier. Thus, the progress and turn to the digital world may be geared as a solution to the falling of social infrastructure. The problem with such apps is that they are designed for efficiency rather than quality, rendering information without hierarchy and resulting in a virtual world where there is no need or desire to maintain physical social infrastructure. How can digital social platforms be used to connect people to rebuild social infrastructure and the city?                 </p>

                    Our goal is to study how media can enhance solidarity by creating effective networks in reality. JOURNEY is an app that enables people to express their opinions on urban environments and find places to meet other people with similar motivations. Our project was inspired by bottom-up urban movements, such as LA Urban Rangers and Death Café: the former develops guided tours to spark creative explorations of everyday habitat; the latter hosts small events in local cafes around the world to discuss death and live a better life. We also look into AR game Ingress for location-based social platforms. In this project, we are specifically analyzing two areas in metropolises: South Jakarta and Wudaokou. Both areas are highly packed commercial districts where spatial rights are always contested. We are speculating that our implementations would help rebuild the social and physical infrastructure of these two areas, which would definitely be developed and implemented in other areas and cities in the future.                </p>
