Students' favorite studyroom. The flagship of Wudaokou.
Although Bridge Café has closed, it should never be remembered only as a popular café and brunch restaurant.  It is a place full of memories for students and residents nearby. Bridge Café invites people from all cultural backgrounds to spend time here; reading, discussing, attending workshops or salons. Its students’ favorite study room. The atmosphere that everyone is studying makes it easier for you to concentrate.  Bridge is spacious enough for everyone to have its own private space, some enjoy the top-floor terrace, some prefer the friendly home-like area, others tend to meet new friends at English learning corner. Staff remember people’s preferences for seats and food,  while the latter then help the former to communicate with foreigners. In Sep 2010,  a monthly basis activity Think in China was created at the Bridge Café by a small group of young researchers who live and work in China. It performs as an informal “agora” , a channel for communicating, and debating on current affairs. . If Wudaokou is China’s academic and cultural crossroad, then Bridge Café is the living room for people from all cultural backgrounds.

It operates 24 hours through the week, providing cheap food combos and midnight discounts. It is a favorite spot of many foreign students and teachers who is looking for a home away from home.

Mon - Sun: 8:00 am - 0:30 am
Korean translation support.
Located near the Liudaokou subway station, Me After You has a preferable location but it is often neglected by local residents as it situated behind a parking area. Once you walked up along the narrow staircase, you will find a spacious ‘living room’. Korean students and Chinese students sit around the central large table, all working on their school work.  Trees cast shadows on windows, some discuss study or work with friends and colleagues, others buried their heads in assignments.  The staff have taken down students’ preferences for drinks and brunch. They even reserve seats for some frequent visitors according to their study schedules.  I have met two real estate agents come to this café to find Korean students to help them communicate with Korean tenants, because they know this café is a home for Korean students.

Zinneken's signature waffle, the Belgian Sugar waffle (aka Liège waffle) is not the waffle sold in most restaurants in America today. It is made from a dense dough encrusted with imported pearl sugar from Belgium. When baked in the waffle irons, the dough cooks and the pearls caramelize. This results in a rich, sweet, indulgent waffle. They use the finest ingredient imported from Europe to make the most authentic Belgian waffle outside Belgium.  The dough is handcrafted in order to ensure the exclusivity of its texture.To ensure freshness, the waffles are baked right in front of you and then topped with your choice of our delectable topping offerings. From fresh berries to imported Belgian chocolate and Speculoos, everything is high quality and delicious!

Founder Tzurit Or started Tatte Bakery & Café in 2007, baking 20 hours a day in her home kitchen and selling her delicious creations to Boston farmers’ markets. After only one summer, Tatte expanded to its first brick-and-mortar bakery in Brookline, Massachusetts. When she opened her very first location she wanted it to feel welcoming, as if someone was hugging you, a home away from home. She has since opened ten Tatte cafes but the aim has always remained the same; each Tatte has its own individual sense of identity, feel and style but they all stay true to the original spirit – to what Tatte is all about.
